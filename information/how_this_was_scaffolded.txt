**HOW THIS PLATFORM WAS SCAFFOLDED**

This is how this platform was setup before entering any new line of codes. Following these steps will recreate an empty app that will be deployable again. But this is only for reference should you wish to build another app from scratch.

For information on how to download and run the latest version of the HRX app please read the `github_workflow.txt`
